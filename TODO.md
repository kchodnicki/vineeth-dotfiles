## Dotfiles

A list of things to make my dotfiles more awesome. A ✓ indicates done and
~~crossed out~~ indicates a defunct item.

- ✓ Add your 1st .vimrc file!
- ✓ Solve the annoying tabs/space problem.
- Take a look at all the optional stuff in the vim plugins you have installed
- Write a script similar to Josh Davis's that will help you install all the plugins automatically and not manually.
- GoldenView looks super awesome
